"""relay-kit/lifecycle@1: what the decision and challenge ledgers say is open, settled, in force or
contested. One pure module, used by check_ledgers, status, export, mcp, cockpit and ledger_append,
so every reader draws the same conclusions from the same lines. Standard library only; reads nothing.

    resolve(decisions, challenges, as_of=None) -> {"decisions": {id: D}, "challenges": {id: C},
                                                   "problems": [P], "conflicts": [X], "as_of": ...}
    ledger_as_of(decisions, challenges)   the time every reader evaluates effective dates against
    line_hash(raw)                        the one hash of a ledger line (raw bytes, as stored)

Rules (docs/lifecycle.md):

- A `supersedes` (one DEC id, as text) takes effect only from a settled line. `adopted` closes any
  earlier decision (a proposal is settled by it; an adopted decision is replaced). `rejected` and
  `superseded` settle a *proposal* only: they cannot retire an adopted decision; that takes an
  adopted line that supersedes or `revokes` it. A `proposed` line that supersedes is a proposed
  replacement: its target stays as it was. Adopting such a proposal also replaces its target.
- A challenge `resolves` (one CH id) takes effect only from a `resolved` or `accepted-risk` line.
- A transition must point at an earlier, different, known record (no self, forward or unknown
  reference, so no cycles); a non-text target is a format problem. Invalid transitions are reported
  and take no effect. A later line repeating an id changes nothing (check_ledgers reports the id).
- More than one effective closing or revoking line on one record is a conflict: every one is kept
  and the conflict reported, never collapsed.
- Applicability of an adopted decision: `standing` ("adopted, no structured supersession found")
  unless an effective later line supersedes it (`superseded`) or revokes it (`revoked`, from that
  line's effective_from, else its date), or its own effective_until has passed (`expired`) or
  effective_from not come (`not yet effective`). An adopted line that only `amends` decisions that
  no longer apply lapses with them (`lapsed with what it amends`). Without `as_of`, dates aren't
  evaluated: a revocation with its own effective_from is then pending, not applied.
