"""relay-kit/telemetry@1: a derived view of how the work is going, rebuilt from the records every time
and never entered by hand. Standard library only; reads the records, writes nothing to them, and
never calls GitHub (pull requests come from governance/pr-state.jsonl, written by relay-kit prs).

    relay-kit telemetry --root RECORDS [--out FILE]      # prints, or writes, the view as JSON

Every metric carries its frozen definition, a version, a label (measured / proxy / estimate, as its
inputs are), its denominator, and "unknown" with a reason where the records can't say: missing is
never zero. Distributions are reported (median, p90, n), never a composite score and never a target.

Metrics (docs/telemetry.md):
  compute_consumption     budget@2 lines, corrections and child runs applied, by method and category
  delivery_throughput     merged PRs per ISO calendar week, by repository; abandoned (closed unmerged) apart
  lead_time               PR created -> merged, hours: median, p90, n (wall clock, never work time)
  review_burden           change-request review rounds per merged PR
  post_merge_remediation  share of merged PRs with an explicitly linked revert or fix within 14 and 30
                          days, counted only for cohorts at least that old (not production CFR)
  human_intervention      self-reported active minutes; unknown otherwise
  surviving_changes       merged PRs not reverted within 14 days (cohort at least 14 days old)
  measurement_coverage    which actors, sessions, PRs and repositories have trustworthy telemetry
  coordination_loss       stale handoffs, cancelled handoffs, overlapping in-progress claims, ledger
                          transition conflicts
