"""Cockpit: one static, self-contained page over a records store: relay-kit/cockpit@4.

    python3 tools/cockpit.py --root RECORDS --out DIR [--lane L] [--content full|metadata]
                             [--weekly-tokens N] [--drift-days N] [--coordinator LANE]
                             [--theme FILE] [--landing SURFACE] [--allow-public-dest]

Writes DIR/index.html (inline CSS and JS, no external resources) and DIR/cockpit.json (the data
the page was built from). Four surfaces:
  Choices    what waits on the owner: proposed decisions, handoffs that need the owner, open
             challenges. Accept / Reject / Defer compose a paste-ready line; nothing is written.
  Topology   information topology (lanes, actors, threads, captures, handoff flows) and
             authority topology (owner -> coordinator -> lanes, plus delegations read from
             in-force decisions, marked inferred), each drawn in SVG.
  Budget     governance/budget.jsonl (if present) against a weekly allowance.
  Run/Drift  handoffs by status, PR links from threads.md, recent decisions, open challenges,
             drift flags.
  Pull requests  governance/pr-state.jsonl (written by relay-kit prs): each PR's What / Why / How /
             Authorized in its author's words, who wrote it, reviews by family, CI.

It reads with the export module's readers (tools/export.py), changes nothing under --root, and
refuses a destination inside the records or inside a public (or unconfirmed) git repository,
using the export's guard. Output is deterministic: no clock is read. The page shows the records'
git revision, its commit time and the last fetch (fixed for a given clone), apart from the newest
record's timestamp; the browser counts their age. Spec: docs/cockpit.md. Standard library only."""
